Welcome! I am **Apurba Debnath**, a researcher working at the intersection of **computational neuroscience, EEG signal analysis, and machine learning**.  
My research focuses on understanding **neural population dynamics**, **oscillatory activity (ERD/ERS)**, and **motor imagery–related brain processes**, with applications to brain–computer interfaces and neurophysiological modeling.

This website serves as a central hub for my **research outputs, publications, talks, teaching activities, and code projects**, and is built using the [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template, hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

## Research Interests
- EEG-based motor imagery and resting-state analysis  
- Neural oscillations (alpha/beta ERD–ERS mechanisms)  
- Computational and biophysical modeling of cortical dynamics  
- Machine learning and statistical modeling for neural data  
- Within-subject and cross-session variability in brain signals

## About This Website
This site is powered by the **Academic Pages** Jekyll template, originally forked from the  
[Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) by Michael Rose and extended specifically for academic use.

The site supports:
- 📄 Publications and preprints  
- 🎤 Talks and presentations  
- 🧠 Research projects and datasets  
- 🧑‍🏫 Teaching and mentoring  
- 📑 A dynamically generated academic CV  

All content is version-controlled and openly hosted, ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and long-term accessibility.
