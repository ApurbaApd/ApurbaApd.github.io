Welcome! I am **Apurba Debnath**, an MS Graduate student at [UC San Francisco](https://www.ucsf.edu)
, specializing in Biomedical Imaging technologies. I am currenltly working with [Prof. Sri Nagarajan](https://radiology.ucsf.edu/people/srikantan-nagarajan), [Prof. Ashish Raj](https://radiology.ucsf.edu/people/ashish-raj) in the compuational neurosciene domain with epilepsy. I am also working with [Prof. Leo P. Sugrue](https://radiology.ucsf.edu/people/leo-sugrue) on deep brain stimulation with Precision neuroimaging. 

Before joining UCSF, I worked on Brain-Computer Interface/compuatational neuroscience as a Postbacc researcher at IIT Madras, India, in collaboration with Paris Brain Institute. My postbacc research was focused on elucidating the underlying neural mechaninsm of BCI control to make biologically informed personalized BCI training prptocols, with [Marie-Constance Corsi](https://www.inria.fr/en/marie-constance-corsi-explorer-cerebral-intention) at Inria-Paris Brain Institute and [Parul Verma](https://ibse.iitm.ac.in/people/parul_verma/) at IBSE, IIT Madras. 

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology with Mathematics and Computer Science in 2024 from NIT Durgapur, India. As an undergraduate researcher, I worked with Prof. Dalia Dasgupta Mandal on drug delivery systems. 

My research focuses on understanding **neural population dynamics**, **structural and functional brain connectivity** ,**Deep-Brain Stimulation**, and **motor imagery–related brain processes**, with applications to brain–computer interfaces and neurophysiological modeling.
